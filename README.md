# FLL-MAR-Tools-Spike-3.0-2023
This repo will contain updated FLL My Blocks for Gyro navigation for Spike Prime 3.0 Robots use in FIRST LEGO League Challenge. Before tackling this you should check out the earlier version FLL-Gyro-And-Line-Follow-My-Blocks for Spike 2.0 that has a detailed explanation of how this all works. 

Start here to understand how these work. This is the original intro to this. [Gyro and Line Follow My Blocks Presentation 2022](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Vga1y9exY-jyWSlCoF_mPb3-asiujL25wlZJDBCBb4c/edit?usp=sharing). There is also a [Presentation Video](https://youtu.be/Y-mmc1qfdfc). This video has an index to the major sections. We suggest you view the **Setup The Environment** section at least once and then jump around as you need. 

There is a Youtube Playlist of videos that explain it all. This is being updated over the next few weeks. 

The above presentsation is a deep dive into the details. There is a shorter presentation called [Help Students Use Line Follow and Gyro Tools](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UHYsoMU4sQItIImVDW6JxholZiNHxqkA5VUVJfzfleM/edit?usp=sharing) that shows what you can do with the new "clean" demo free versions. For this version you want the Spike Prime 3.0 Clean file in this repo.  

We have added a [MAR Tools Line Follow and Gyro Q&A](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ImXs9dXHien4vxTaczBTmVpKdwTA2yu8wNJbacyhVYc/edit?usp=sharing). This will defien the variables we use and report some Q&A we are receiving.
